# Twitter GiveAway Bot Using Tweepy

This is a bot created in python it uses [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), the goal of this project was to fully automate the process of entering giveaways. Now you can automate the processes of retweeting, replying, favoriting and following, the bot will even reply to direct messages and mentions.

### Maintenance
